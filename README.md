# If you're a beginner in the C language or want to practice there is some challanges for you to train your C! #

Why to Learn C Programming?
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:

1.Easy to learn

2.Structured language

3.It produces efficient programs

4.It can handle low-level activities

5.It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms


## How to compile and run C code? ##
You can run C code using gcc.exe file. You can find it by downloading mingw (mingw32\bin\gcc.exe).

Using (I'm recommend to add mingw32\bin to your path for using it in this way):
```batch
  gcc your_c_code.c
```
(The output usually is a.exe)
You can write one short batch script that compiles and run your code! It'll save your time:
```batch
gcc your_c_code.c
a.exe
```

For example go call this file run.bat and after you create it you can open cmd window in the same location and just type:
```batch
run
```
To compile and run this code!.

### Note 1: you can add -o parameter to the gcc command to give the executable file different name. For example: gcc your_c_code.c -o custom_name.exe
### Note 2: I'm working again on new challengs, current target: 100 challenges (15 Done) ### <- Please change this after adding new chanllanges
